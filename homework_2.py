# rock paper scissors
# Write a set of if/else/elif statements that compare two variables 'user_input' and 'computer_input'
# These variables contain the strings `rock`, `paper', or 'scissors'
# Implement the rules as if/else/elif statements after line 10 with an indentation of 4 spaces, see example (line 10+11)
# Return a string saying 'tied game', 'you win', or 'computer wins' after every statement
# If there is no error when you run the script, you succeeded
# Push the solution in your repo
